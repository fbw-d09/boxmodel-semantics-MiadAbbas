            <ol>
<li>Advertise on your website</li>
<p>Just by having a site of your own, you can start earning passive income. There are just a handful of steps you’ll need to take to build a website that makes money online. First you’ll need to choose from one of many professionally designed website templates, select a domain name and get free website hosting. Then you can begin thinking about the different routes toward monetizing your website. 


    One proven method time and again is online advertising. You can use <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/" target="_blank">Google AdSense</a>  to place ads on your website. This option is relatively easy as Google matchs ads to your site based on your content and visitors, plus it’s free. Google then pays you based on the number of views or clicks you get on the ads.</p>
<li>Design websites</li>
<p>So, you might be asking yourself, “How do I find my ideal customer?” Joining a distinguished online marketplace for<a href="https://www.wix.com/marketplace/join" target="_blank">website designers</a>  is the best possible way to start generating qualified leads. You’ll get a platform to help you showcase your work, set your price rate and get matched with potential clients who are looking to hire your services. You can also consider partnering with companies that grant you access to special web design tools. As a Wix Partner, you'll get professional resources and be able to enlist the expert help of a company account manager dedicated to increasing your sales funnel conversion. </p>
<li> Create a blog</li>
<p>The wonderful thing about blogging is that you can create content about absolutely anything as long as there are people interested in reading it. After some time, your free blog will attract website traffic and offer monetization opportunities. This is one of the reasons blogging is a great <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2021/09/digital-nomad-jobs/" target="_blank">digital nomad job. </a> 
</p>
<li>Open an online store</li>
<p>Internet shopping has become synonymous with convenience. As a result, people are purchasing more goods online than ever before. You can grab a slice of this profitable eCommerce pie by opening your own online store. Be sure to choose an <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">eCommerce website</a>  builder that offers advanced business features, including secure payment and checkout, shipping and marketing tools, and store analytics to help you run your venture. </p>
<li>Start dropshipping</li>
<p>Did you know that you can be an online seller without needing to stock up on products? Dropshipping lets you sell items using a third-party retailer that completely manages the order fulfillment process. All you have to do is find the right products for your business and connect with a supplier. This also means that you can begin a dropshipping business right away and start accepting customers as soon as you integrate your dropshipping products into your website.</p>

<li>Offer paid memberships</li>
<p>The truth is that there are ways to make money online which can strengthen your website. Integrating a membership area to your site is one of them. The idea is that you offer paid membership to your site in exchange for access to exclusive perks.</p>
<li>Sell secondhand goods</li>
<p>We all have that bag under the bed. It might be full of clothes you don’t wear anymore, your Lego collection or your original kicks. While you may have outgrown them, many of these saved items are still too precious to toss out onto the street. Rather, you can free up some space and make some decent money by selling these items secondhand. Get on Ebay or Amazon, determine the asking price for your stuff and sit back, relax and watch the offers come rolling in. 
</p>
<li>Sell photographs</li>
<p>If you’re a photographer, why not capitalize on your skills by creating a photography website to sell your photos online? It may take some promotion and a little bit of patience, but if you already have a large photo collection, you can focus most of your efforts on branding and marketing. In addition, companies like Shutterstock, iStockPhoto and Shutterfly are willing to make use of your creative snaps. You can become a paid contributor to any of these stock photo platforms by submitting your best content via their site.</p>
<li>Offer print on demand</li>
<p>As a designer looking for ways to make money online, you’ve probably considered the idea of selling your own merchandise. This lets you hit two birds with one stone, as you’ll be gaining exposure while also generating a steady flow of revenue. But how would you go about it?


    Print on demand is a low-risk method of selling your designs on custom t-shirts, posters, books and more. It eliminates the hassle of buying and managing inventory. All you have to do is connect your online store with a print on demand service and choose the types of products you want to sell - whether that’s clothing, homeware, prints or accessories.</p>
<li>Begin freelancing </li>
<p>Successful freelancers know how to earn money online, cultivating a new standard of business in which efficiency and flexibility go hand in hand. Whether you’re a freelance writer, artist, educator or website designer, you’ll find a marketplace that’s diverse and flourishing. </p>
